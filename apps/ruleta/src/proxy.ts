 * Optional HTTP Basic Auth gate for the whole wheel app (pages + API routes).
 *
 * Next 16 file convention: this is `proxy.ts` (the former `middleware.ts`),
 * exporting a `proxy` function. It runs on the server before every matched
 * request.
 *
 * - Local use: leave `RULETA_BASIC_AUTH` unset — every request passes through,
 *   exactly like before.
 * - Hosted use: set `RULETA_BASIC_AUTH="username:password"` in the deployment's
 *   environment. The browser then prompts for credentials on first load and
 *   sends them on every request, so the service_role-backed API is never open
 *   to the public URL.
 *
 * This is a shared-secret gate, not real user management. Pair it with a
 * strong password and, ideally, your host's own protections (rate limiting,
 * IP allow-lists). For anything more, put a real auth proxy in front.
